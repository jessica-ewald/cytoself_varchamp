------ Root dir filling up ------
dgx root dir is 91% full. I have 6.8GB stored there. It's mostly:
./.cache = 4.6GB
./.vscode-server = 2.2GB

How do I stop these from storing files in my home directory instead of dgxnas1?


------ Zarr files taking up way more space -------
My .zarr files are taking up ~5x as much space as the .tiff version. My understanding is that it should be smaller. 
Can look at several things: did re-scaling change the number of decimals/data type?
If so, can I round/convert to a different type?
Zarr supports compression. Does this help? 
If I convert, does it take way longer to access data from compressed files?


------ /dgxnas1 is almost full -------
89% full - 2.4T of space remaining.
The 'dgxnas1/cellpainting-datasets' dir has several very large datasets - seems like it's from Juan Caicedo. 
Can we delete any of these?
