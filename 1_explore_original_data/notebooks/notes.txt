------ Root dir filling up ------
dgx root dir is 91% full. I have 6.8GB stored there. It's mostly:
./.cache = 4.6GB
./.vscode-server = 2.2GB

How do I stop these from storing files in my home directory instead of dgxnas1?


------ Zarr files taking up way more space -------
My .zarr files are taking up ~5x as much space as the .tiff version. My understanding is that it should be smaller. 
Can look at several things: did re-scaling change the number of decimals/data type?
If so, can I round/convert to a different type?
Zarr supports compression. Does this help? 
If I convert, does it take way longer to access data from compressed files?


------ /dgxnas1 is almost full -------
89% full - 2.4T of space remaining.
The 'dgxnas1/cellpainting-datasets' dir has several very large datasets - seems like it's from Juan Caicedo. 
Can we delete any of these? 



------ Things to try with Cytoself ------
________TO DO _________
-Make UMAP with CP features after applying all of the filtering steps
-Compare AUROC, cell count p-val, intensity p-val and see whether embeddings are really localization-specific
-Train model with pooled-rare data
-Organize scripts: make a folder for each dataset, and include .py script for training the model & analyzing the results
-Try train with more channels (perhaps use the pooled-rare for this, if it works, since we don't have the confocal issue? However this one has very few alleles)
-Try use pre-trained model - we have 3 datasets: OpenCell, Varchamp, and pooled-rare. Does combining all of the data make it better? Or worse?
-If we can train together ... OpenCell is a different cell line. Would be interesting to see which overlapping genes have similar vs. different localization.
-Try without protein channel - does the model still learn something useful? If so, it could be used for other morphology-only datasets.
-Retrain XGBoost classifiers with localization embeddings

________DONE_________
-Annotate UMAP organelles - basic first pass
